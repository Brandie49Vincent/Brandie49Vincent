## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a UX/UI designer with a passion for crafting intuitive, engaging, and easy-to-navigate interfaces for both mobile and web applications. With a strong foundation in user-centered design principles and visual storytelling, I strive to create digital experiences that are not only beautiful but also meaningful and functional. This space showcases my design work, creative explorations, and the processes behind them.

My primary tools include Sketch and Figma, which I use to bring ideas to lifeâ€”from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity interactive prototypes. I focus on designing clean layouts, thoughtful user flows, and visually cohesive systems that enhance usability and elevate the overall user experience. Whether it's designing for iOS, Android, or responsive web, I aim to create consistent and accessible designs that work across all platforms.

I take a research-driven approach to design, starting with understanding user needs, mapping journeys, and validating concepts through usability testing and feedback. I enjoy collaborating closely with developers, product teams, and other stakeholders to ensure that design decisions align with both user goals and business objectives.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find UI kits, design systems, wireframes, prototypes, and case studies from recent projects. Each project reflects a part of my design processâ€”problem-solving, iteration, and refinement with a focus on clarity and user satisfaction.

Feel free to explore the files, leave feedback, or connect if you're interested in collaboration. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to projects that value thoughtful design.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find inspiration or useful insights in the work shared here.
